# Elderly Motion Tracking System with AI Enabled Edge Computing
This project is a motion detection and tracking system for the elderly, employing AI and edge computing. It utilizes web camera footage processed by YOLOv8 and Bytetrack models for object detection and tracking. The system trains a custom model using pose estimation for activity recognition, with results stored in a Firebase database, accessible via a Flutter web app.
